# ML Algorithms Playground

This project is a collection of implementations and experiments with various **classification** and **regression** algorithms using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/), along with supporting libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas.  
It is intended as a learning playground to better understand how different machine learning models work, how to evaluate them, and how to visualize their performance.
